Velluminous is a simple addon to fix a simple problem.  I *never* enchant directly onto items since vellums were introduced, so enchanting from the tradeskill frame has been a two-click annoyance for me.  This addon simply adds a button that lets you enchant right to vellum in one click.  Instantly doubling your productivity!
